General notes on installing extensions.

We've been doing everything as root, so run 'sudo su -' first. There's probably better ways using sudo, but with the
virtual environment it looks to be a little tricky.

Sometimes installation instructions will assume that the extension is already on your machine
for example https://github.com/HHS/ckanext-datajson just assumes that you've already cloned the code down.

In such instances you can

cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src

and either get the zip file of the version you want (probably the master) or

git clone https://github.com/HHS/ckanext-datajson.git

And then from there follow the instructions which will include a setup.py

The nicer extensions use pip install -e to get the source code into /usr/lib/ckan/default/src instead of cloning + setup.py.

See the pip install documention for info on 'pip install -e' and setup.py.

IMPORTANT:

If the extension's documentation says it has tests, you should run them after following the installation instructions.
