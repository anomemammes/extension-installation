This document covers how we set up the ckan test suite. It is based on this:

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-2.6.0/contributing/test.html


####
# Utility scripts
####
See ckan-tests-bin.zip for utility scripts. Put these scripts into the ubuntu user's ~/bin.


####
# Configure test-core.ini
###

They mention development.ini, but they seem to want to use test-core.ini so

Update /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/test-core.ini:

sqlalchemy.url to ckan_test
ckan.datastore.write_url to ckan_test
ckan.datastore.read_url to datastore_test
solr_url to the solr dev instance, in our case it's the one in /etc/ckan/default/production.ini

######
# Install packages we need to run tests
#####

Need to be root to install packages (well, you could probably do this sudo -H, but moving along...)
sudo su -
. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate
pip install -r /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/dev-requirements.txt

Running that gave me a couple 'SyntaxError: invalid syntax' but I ran the command again
and it seemed happy, so moving on...

#######
# Create test tables
#######

To make working with the databases easier (don't have to type passwords) make a
~.pgppass file
#hostname:port:database:username:password

There's a script you can use ~/bin/drpsql
to make connecting to the postgres instances a little easier, eg `drpsql ckan_default` or `drpsql datasotre_default`. If you wanted to
look around on the database.

then:

createdb --host=your-db --port=your-port --username=ckan_default -O ckan_default ckan_test -E utf-8
createdb --host=your-db --port=your-port --username=ckan_default -O ckan_default datastore_test -E utf-8

Then

paster --plugin=ckan datastore set-permissions -c /etc/ckan/default/test-core.ini | drpsql ckan_default

This will give you warnings for DB objects that already have the correct permissions, seems fine.

# Script to run tests
####

Scripts in ~/bin/

run-ckan-tests
run-tests-easy

run-tests-easy calls run-ckan-tests. Use run-tests-easy to run tests like

run-tests-easy output-file.txt

It uses nohup so you can logout and not worry about it.

run-ckan-tests has some tests excluded using the nose -e argument - see comments in run-ckan-tests for why.

If you want to add more tests to the script, you can add them to run-ckan-tests. For example for 
new extensions you install.
