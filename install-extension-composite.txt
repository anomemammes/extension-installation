The strategy for installing an exention.

1) Install the extension. If the extension has it's own tests, follow the instructions to run those. 

2) Log into the ckan box and

run-tests-easy output-file.txt

They currently take about 25 minutes to run. Using nohup will allow us to log out
accidentally or on purpose.

3) Check output-file.txt for errors.

These warnings are okay (apparantly):

usr/lib/ckan/default/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/unitofwork.py:79: SAWarning: Usage of the 'related attribute set' operation is not\
 currently supported within the execution stage of the flush process. Results may not be consistent.  Consider using alternative event listeners or connection-level operations ins\
tead.
  sess._flush_warning("related attribute set")


Exception TypeError: TypeError('exceptions must be old-style classes or derived from BaseException, not NoneType',) in <bound method Solr.__del__ of <pysolr.Solr object at 0x7f3a6\
bb98190>> ignored



4) Log into the site and make sure everything seems okay.
